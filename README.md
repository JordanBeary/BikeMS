# TUN Data Challenge 2018 : National Multiple Sclerosis Society - Bike MS

To provide some context for our analysis, here is some background information about Bike MS and the business problems they have been facing the past couple of years. The following can be found on the `Business Questions` page on the Teradata University Network Data Challenge website:

Bike MS is the National MS Society’s largest fundraising campaign, engaging over 70,000 participants to raise $68 million in over 75 rides across the country. It is the largest charity cycling series in the United States.

The rides are typically one- or two-day events that are a reasonable driving distance from metropolitan areas and are fully supported with first aid, mechanics, rest areas, shuttles, and more. When not on the route, activity is centered in a “village” atmosphere where participants have access to vendors, dining, beer gardens, camping (in some locations), team tents, and entertainment. The routes themselves range from 10 to 100 miles per day and cyclists can decide for themselves which route to ride.

The events are team-focused, with teams responsible for 87% of fundraising. Because of participant demographics (mostly male, middle age, higher income earners), we know that Bike MS is an ideal corporate event and that corporate teams of 10 or more cyclists are seven times more valuable than any other kind of team. Companies with a large professional employee base, especially those with a corporate culture of health and wellness – regardless of industry – are key prospects.

Over the years, the charity cycling space has become very crowded with many events vying for the same audience. Bike MS participation and revenue have seen a steady decline since our peak in 2012. While retention is relatively high – over 50% – there are not enough new participants joining the series to reverse the damage caused by attrition. We must increase new participant acquisition.

We know that cyclists join Bike MS because they were asked by someone they know – not us. However, team captains are usually recruited by staff and volunteers early in the event year. Team captains who are effective recruiters are our greatest asset, especially from corporate teams. However, digital marketing efforts are strong in some markets and may make an impact in our acquisition goals.

Last year, we had 74,000 riders and a total of 6,150 teams. Our goal for 2018 is 80,572 riders (40,000 new who have not participated within the last five years), and 6,489 teams.

Teams with 10+ members raise 3x more than teams with fewer than 10 members. In 2017, we had 1,561 teams with 10+ members; 642 of those were corporate 10+ teams. For greatest revenue return, we must attract new corporate teams that will recruit at least 10 members to participate.
